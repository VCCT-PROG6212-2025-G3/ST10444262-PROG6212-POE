1. Introduction 
This POE entails the creation of a Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS). The 
purpose of this system is to streamline the submission and approval of monthly claims 
for the independently contracted lecturers. Lecturers will be able to submit claims 
based on their hourly wage and hours worked, and any relevant supporting 
documents, where once submitted it can be verified by the Programme Co-ordinator 
and finally approved by the Academic Manager. Claim status will be transparent 
throughout the administrative process. The key users for this system is the lecturer 
who will be submitting the claims, the Programme Co-ordinator who will be verifying 
the claims, the Academic Manager who will accept the claims, and finally an Admin 
whose sole responsibility is the account creation of both Programme Co-ordinator and 
Academic Manager and will not interfere with any of the claim processes. The project 
is currently in its prototype phase outlining the projects database, GUI and project plan, 
which mean that there is no current functionality.
